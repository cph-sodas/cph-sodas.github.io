This means that the server you log in to is just a middle layer, and that to access the compute resources of the old server (i.e. the GPUs, memory, CPU) one must use the Slurm commands (see under usage).</p> <p>Two: To better structure projects and data, all projects should be stored in the <code>/projects/</code>. These are <code>compute projects</code> and are created through the self service portal (see setup). When you access the compute resources through Slurm, your code and data must be in a projects directory, since that server does not have access to your other network drives.</p> <p>Three: We strongly recommend that you use <code>uv</code> to manage your Python projects and virtual environments, one reason being the difficulties around the licensing of conda default channels, the other that <code>uv</code> helps you enforce better reproducibility, and is most use cases also faster.</p> <p>This is also new for us, so please reach out with any questions or suggestions for improvement, but please be patient.</p>"},{"location":"server/access/","title":"Access","text":"<p>In order to access the server, you need to contact the datalab with your basic information and SODAS affiliation, and they will help setup up an account for you.
